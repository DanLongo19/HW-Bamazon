# HW-Bamazon

My Bamazon App is functioning somewhat properly, but I think I made an error with MySQL where the table is giving me more than the 10 product results I need (I think I populated the table too many times to make sure it was working before adding it to Visual Studio Code).

The inquirer prompts are functioning correctly (screenshots attached)

But I am not sure the products are properly being calculcated once purhcased...
